# LeetCode Problem Solving Repository

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, solved consistently as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice.

The goal of this repo is simple:
- Build strong problem-solving skills
- Master core DSA patterns
- Maintain a clean, revision-friendly codebase

---

## What You’ll Find Here

- Problems solved from LeetCode
- Solutions written mainly in Java
- Focus on clarity, correctness, and optimal approaches
- Problems categorized by topic and technique

---

## Problem Categories

The repository includes problems from the following areas:

- Arrays
- Strings
- Sliding Window
- Two Pointers
- Hashing
- Prefix Sum
- Recursion
- Linked List
- Stack and Queue
- Binary Search
- Trees
- Binary Search Tree
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms

## Approach Followed

For most problems, I follow this structure:

1. Brute force approach (if applicable)
2. Better or optimized approach
3. Optimal approach
4. Time and space complexity analysis

This helps in understanding why a solution works and how it is expected in interviews.
